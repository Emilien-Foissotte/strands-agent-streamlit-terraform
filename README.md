# Streamlit Strands Terraform demo

This app demonstrates how to build and deploy a GenAI agent with a web user interface using Streamlit and Terraform with AWS provider. While the demo uses a simple appointment management agent (described in the [agent description section](#agent-description)), the main focus is on the deployment architecture and user interface implementation.

It is based on the streamlit-template sample from this repo:
